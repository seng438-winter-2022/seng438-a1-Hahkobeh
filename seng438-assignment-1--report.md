# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We want to test the system as if we were a user, we will test all features generally in order to 
make sure that the system functions well as a whole.  Therefore, we want to test the most common paths. 
We will focus on functionalities such as depositing and withdrawing to specific accounts. We want our 
system to work for the most amount of users. While also ensuring no large bugs exist when working 
with depositing/withdrawing money as that may be very stressful for a user.
